# PythonCalculator

This is **Project 1** of **IS 601**. A calculator using Python.

## Description:
The calculator is one application that we all use in our day to day lives. This **PythonCalculator** is Python program using principles of automated testing. It performs basic arithmetic operations. I Learned to use static methods, object methods, object attributes/properties. And also use the CSV files to load data for unit tests. There's each file to test the associated operation. 

## Operations:
* Addition,
* Subtraction,
* Multiplication,
* Division,
* Square,
* Square root

## Resources reuqired to run the Unit tests are,

* [Calculator.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/Calculator.py) (It contians all python function to perform arithmetic operations).
* [CalculatorTests.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/CalculatorTests.py) (Unit Test file to perfom individual tests of source code).
* [CsvReader.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/CsvReader.py) (To read the csv file and convert the data into list, and dictionary to store in memory.).
* [StaticVariables.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/StaticVariables.py) (To refer to the common property of all objects).
* [CSV File](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/tree/master/src/csv) (comma-separated values files are used to read and test data in Unit Tests).
